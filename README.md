# Hi there, I'm Derrin Bright 👋

### Bioinformatics | Biotechnology | AI in Biology

[cite_start]I'm a final-year B.Tech Biotechnology student at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) [cite: 8] with a deep focus on applying computational biology and machine learning to solve complex biological problems.

[cite_start]My work and research experience involves analyzing transcriptomic data (both scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq) [cite: 30, 58][cite_start], building bioinformatics pipelines for genomic analysis [cite: 26][cite_start], and developing machine learning models for diagnostics and prediction. [cite: 31, 62]

[cite_start]I'm currently a **Research Intern at Boston University** [cite: 24] [cite_start]and the **University of Liverpool** [cite: 28][cite_start], and I am excited to be joining the **Guillaume Thibault Lab at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**, for my upcoming final year capstone project.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are a few highlights of my work. You can find more in my repositories!

### 1. Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling of the B16 Melanoma's Microenvironment
- [cite_start]**What I did:** Processed raw scRNA-seq data using R (Seurat), executing a full pipeline from quality control and normalization to clustering and UMAP visualization. [cite: 58]
- [cite_start]**Outcome:** Successfully mapped the tumor's cellular heterogeneity and annotated 14 distinct cell types by performing differential expression analysis to find their unique gene signatures. [cite: 59]
- [cite_start]**[GitHub Link]** [cite: 57]

### 2. In Silico Analysis of 3DTC/CEP-6331 Complex using Molecular Docking
- [cite_start]**What I did:** Implemented a full molecular docking simulation with AutoDock Vina to model the interaction between a kinase (3DTC) and its inhibitor (CEP-6331). [cite: 54]
- [cite_start]**Outcome:** Achieved a strong predicted binding affinity of -12.23 kcal/mol and analyzed the binding pose to identify the key hydrophobic and polar amino acid residues responsible for the stable interaction. [cite: 54, 55]
- [cite_start]**[GitHub Link]** [cite: 53]

### 3. Transcriptomic Comparison of HPV-Associated Cancers
- [cite_start]**What I did:** Analyzed TCGA transcriptomic data for HPV-associated cancers to perform differential expression analysis and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). [cite: 46]
- [cite_start]**Outcome:** Identified key co-expression modules and constructed a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network in Cytoscape to determine the shared biological roles of core genes. [cite: 46, 47]

### 4. Asthma Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
- [cite_start]**What I did:** Developed multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting) to predict asthma risk. [cite: 62]
- [cite_start]**Outcome:** Optimized model accuracy by using Grid Search Cross-Validation for hyperparameter tuning and applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive features. [cite: 62, 63]
- [cite_start]**[GitHub Link]** [cite: 61]
